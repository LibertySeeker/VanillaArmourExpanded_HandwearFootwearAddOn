Hey, X here or bun or whatever, just Quickly want to drop in and say that this is my first ever mod I'm releasing publically.
I have in mind to continue developing it and adding more content, bug fixes and rebalances.

Please don't expect any major addition to the game, atleast not now, or anything mind blowing. These are just filler items I thought VAE could use (Vanilla Armour expanded)

Also It's integral that you have Vanilla armour and core expanded enabled. The mod bases and will base several hand and footwear on research, and armors added exclusively by the mod, however without VAE you can still enjoy recon set for now.

Lastly, I wanna say that I in no way associate myself with Oscar Pottocki, or any other developer who took play in Vanilla Armour Expanded. I have only reused their Marine glove and boot textures as templates to stay inline with their artstyle, as well as the base of their code for their handwear and footwear apparel category.

You have all rights to use, reuse, share, modify and otherwise interact with this mod under GNU General Public License.

Lastly for Vanilla Expanded Associates, you are within your right to take this mod down, and I will do so willingly, let us avoid legal action (if on any basis you find copyright infringement)
